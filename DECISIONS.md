# DECISIONS.md

Long-term architectural and product decisions for pre-portfolio.

Only durable decisions belong here. Always record _why_ — not just what.

## Active Decisions

### Framework: Next.js App Router

**Date:** 2025-05 (project init)
**Decision:** Use Next.js with the App Router (not Pages Router).
**Reason:** App Router enables React Server Components, layouts, and streaming — better for a content-heavy portfolio. Next.js 16 is in use.
**Implications:** All pages live under `src/app/`. API routes live under `src/app/api/`. No `pages/` directory.

---

### Styling: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui

**Date:** 2025-05 (project init)
**Decision:** Tailwind CSS as the utility framework; shadcn/ui for reusable components.
**Reason:** shadcn/ui gives full component ownership (no external package dependency) while Tailwind keeps styling co-located with markup.
**Implications:** shadcn components are copied into `src/components/ui/` and owned by this repo. Do not `npm install` shadcn component packages. Use `npx shadcn add <component>` to add new ones.

---

### Theme: Zinc + Lime (shadcn preset b8QyST2lZC)

**Date:** 2025-05-14
**Decision:** Use shadcn's Zinc base color with Lime primary. Override dark `--background` to `oklch(0 0 0)` (pure black) to match DESIGN.md `bg/page` token.
**Reason:** Lime (`#f2fb7a`) is already the brand accent in the Figma design — making it the shadcn primary unifies the component library and the design system. Zinc provides the modern neutral dark-gray scale. Evaluated in dark mode — the primary experience. Violet was considered and rejected: too close to generic SaaS purple.
**Implications:** All `--primary` usages render in lime. The lime primary IS the DESIGN.md `accent/primary` token — they are the same color, not two separate systems.

---

### Animation: GSAP + Motion (Framer Motion)

**Date:** 2025-05 (project init)
**Decision:** Use both GSAP (via `@gsap/react`) and Motion for animations.
**Reason:** GSAP for complex timeline animations and scroll-triggered sequences; Motion for simpler component-level transitions.
**Implications:** Do not add a third animation library. If a new animation need arises, use one of these two.

---

### Email: Resend

**Date:** 2025-05 (migrated from nodemailer)
**Decision:** Contact form email delivery via Resend SDK.
**Reason:** Resend is simpler to configure for transactional email in serverless (Next.js API routes) than nodemailer. Migrated per git history.
**Implications:** `RESEND_API_KEY` env var required. Email sending logic lives in `src/app/api/send-email/route.ts`.

---

### Package Manager: pnpm

**Date:** 2025-05 (project init)
**Decision:** Use pnpm as the package manager.
**Reason:** Faster installs, strict dependency resolution, disk-efficient.
**Implications:** Use `pnpm add` / `pnpm install`. Do not use npm or yarn. `pnpm-lock.yaml` is the lockfile.

---

### Design Source of Truth: DESIGN.md + Figma

**Date:** 2025-05-13
**Decision:** All visual tokens (colors, typography, spacing, radius) are documented in `DESIGN.md`, extracted from the Figma file `Portfolio`.
**Reason:** Single source of truth prevents drift between design and code. AI agents must read `DESIGN.md` before any UI work.
**Implications:** If a design token changes, update `DESIGN.md` first, then the code.

---

### Style Guide: STYLE.md as Daily Reference

**Date:** 2026-05-20
**Decision:** Add `STYLE.md` as a compact style and implementation-pattern reference derived from the current repo.
**Reason:** `DESIGN.md` contains exact Figma tokens, while future implementation work benefits from a shorter guide that captures product feel, stack boundaries, typography roles, color usage, component conventions, and agent workflow.
**Implications:** `DESIGN.md` remains the source of truth for exact visual tokens. `STYLE.md` should summarize, not replace, those decisions and must be updated when durable style guidance changes.

---

### Component Co-location Strategy

**Date:** 2025-05-14
**Decision:** Shared layout components (`Nav`, `Footer`, `CTASection`, `LiveBadge`) live in `src/components/`. Page-specific section components (e.g. `HeroSection`, `TechStacksCard`) also live in `src/components/` — not colocated inside `src/app/` route folders.
**Reason:** All section components are candidates for reuse across pages (e.g. `CTASection` appears on every page). Keeping them in `src/components/` keeps the `app/` directory clean and route-focused.
**Implications:** `src/app/*/page.tsx` files are thin assemblers — they import and compose section components, they don't define them inline.

---

### Typography Split: Display vs. Heading vs. Body

**Date:** 2025-05-14
**Decision:** Three distinct font roles enforced at the CSS base layer:

- `h1` → Instrument Serif italic (`--font-display`) — hero/display moments only
- `h2`, `h3` → Visby CF upright (`--font-heading`) — all UI section headings
- `body` → Inter (`--font-body`) — all running text
- `html` → Visby CF via `font-sans` — shadcn UI components (buttons, labels, inputs)
  **Reason:** Matches DESIGN.md exactly. Instrument Serif loses its impact if used everywhere. Visby CF handles all UI weight.
  **Implications:** Never use `font-display` or Instrument Serif on anything below `h1`. Hero split text (e.g. "Hi there, I'm **Gilead Odo**") is achieved with inline `<em>` + `<strong>` spans, not separate heading levels.

---

### Hero Typography Pattern

**Date:** 2025-05-14
**Decision:** The hero heading split — italic serif for the dim half, bold sans for the name — is implemented as a single `<h1>` containing two `<span>` elements: one with `font-display italic` (Instrument Serif) and one with `font-heading font-bold` (Visby CF). Not two separate elements.
**Reason:** Matches Figma exactly. The two halves are semantically one heading. Keeping them in one `<h1>` preserves correct document outline and GSAP SplitText targeting.
**Implications:** The `split-parent` / `split-char` GSAP classes apply to the `<h1>` wrapper, not the inner spans.

---

### Works Data: Static TypeScript File

**Date:** 2025-05-14
**Decision:** Project/works data (title, slug, description, badge, links, tech stack, images) is stored in a static TypeScript file at `src/lib/works.ts`, not in a CMS or database.
**Reason:** Portfolio content changes infrequently. A static file gives type safety, zero latency, and no external dependency. Adding a CMS later is a straightforward migration.
**Implications:** `src/app/works/[slug]/page.tsx` uses `generateStaticParams` to pre-render all case study pages at build time.

---

### base-ui Button Link Pattern

**Date:** 2025-05-14
**Decision:** When a `<Button>` needs to render as a navigation link (`<Link>` or `<a>`), use `render={<Link href="..." />}` + `nativeButton={false}`. Never use `asChild` with base-ui components.
**Reason:** base-ui's `ButtonPrimitive` warns when `nativeButton={true}` (the default) and a non-`<button>` is passed to `render`. `asChild` forwards as an unknown DOM prop. Setting `nativeButton={false}` silences the warning and opts out of native button semantics intentionally.
**Implications:** All CTA buttons wrapping `<Link>` or `<a>` must include both props. `asChild` is banned on any base-ui component.

---

### shadcn/ui Components Use base-ui (Not Radix UI)

**Date:** 2025-05-14
**Decision:** The shadcn preset `b8QyST2lZC` ships components backed by `@base-ui/react` instead of `@radix-ui/react`. Use the `render` prop pattern to customize trigger elements — not `asChild`.
**Reason:** Discovered when `<SheetTrigger asChild><Button /></SheetTrigger>` caused nested `<button>` hydration errors. base-ui's `asChild` passes a real `<button>` from `DialogTrigger`, which then wraps the `<Button>` (another `<button>`), producing invalid HTML.
**Implications:** Any component that wraps a base-ui trigger (Sheet, Dialog, Popover, etc.) must use `render={<Button ... />}` instead of `asChild`. Children of the trigger become its content, not the element itself.

---

### CTASection: Shared Across All Pages

**Date:** 2025-05-14
**Decision:** The "Have a project in mind?" section is a single shared component used on every page above the footer.
**Reason:** It appears identically on Home, Works, Works > View, and Contact in the Figma designs.
**Implications:** Any copy/button changes need only be made in one place.

<!-- ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
     MULTI-AGENT ORG UPGRADE
     Frozen routing rules for the multi-agent org. HR must apply them
     as stated and must not override them without an explicit engineer instruction.

## Agent Routing Decisions

### Default Routing Pattern — Parallel Sub-Agents

**Date:** 2026-05-22
**Decision:** Default to parallel sub-agents for all task phases where data shapes are pre-defined before work begins.
**Reason:** Sub-agents are cheaper, simpler, and sufficient when contracts between layers are already known. There is no coordination overhead and each agent can proceed independently.
**Implications:** HR must not escalate to Agent Teams unless the escalation trigger below is explicitly met. Defaulting to Agent Teams when sub-agents would suffice is a routing error.

---

### Escalation Trigger — Agent Teams

**Date:** 2026-05-22
**Decision:** Escalate to Agent Teams when a new API route, its consuming query hook, and its UI component are being defined in the same task and must negotiate a shared TypeScript interface before either layer can proceed.
**Reason:** Sub-agents cannot coordinate contracts peer-to-peer. When no response type exists in the codebase yet, independent workers will produce mismatched interfaces that require rework.
**Implications:** HR detects this condition by checking whether a route response type already exists in the codebase before assigning workers. If the type exists, sub-agents are sufficient. If it does not, Agent Teams are required for the affected phases only — not the entire task.

## Superseded Decisions

### Email: Nodemailer (superseded)

**Date:** superseded 2025-05
**Replaced by:** Resend
**Reason for change:** Simpler serverless compatibility, better developer experience.
