I learned the importance of building flexible systems that can handle incomplete states, delayed actions, and constantly changing business rules without making the UI feel chaotic. The project also deepened my understanding of trust-driven product design. Features like recurring payments, tenancy agreements, and tenant verification carry financial and legal weight, so clarity became more important than visual complexity. I became more intentional about reducing friction, communicating system states clearly, and designing interfaces that helped users feel confident about important actions. Technically, it reinforced the value of scalable frontend architecture. Managing large forms, nested workflows, async payment states, and reusable dashboard components taught me how important predictable state management, strong typing, and modular UI systems are as products grow.",
